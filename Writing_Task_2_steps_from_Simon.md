## Step 1: Analyze the Question (2 min)

Key Keywords to Consider:
House vs. Apartment
More advantages or more disadvantages?
Task Requirements:
Discuss both advantages and disadvantages of living in a house.
Give a clear position on whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Provide reasons and examples to support your argument.

## Step 2: Plan the Essay (5 min)

### Thesis Statement (Main Opinion):

Living in a house has more advantages than disadvantages due to greater space and privacy, although higher costs and maintenance responsibilities can be drawbacks.
Main Ideas for Body Paragraphs:
Advantages of Living in a House:
More space and comfort → Allows for larger rooms, a backyard, and personal amenities.
Greater privacy and freedom → No shared walls, less noise, and more control over renovations.
Disadvantages of Living in a House:
Higher costs → Houses are more expensive in terms of purchase price, rent, and utilities.
Maintenance responsibilities → Owners must handle repairs, lawn care, and general upkeep.

## Step 3: Write the Introduction (5-6 sentences)

### Structure:

Paraphrase the question
Give a thesis statement (state your position clearly)
Outline the main points
Introduction Paragraph:
✅ Some people prefer living in a house, while others find apartments more suitable. Each option has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, which often depend on lifestyle preferences and financial situations. This essay argues that living in a house offers more benefits overall, as it provides greater space and privacy. However, the higher costs and maintenance responsibilities cannot be ignored.

## Step 4: Write Body Paragraph 1 (Advantages of Living in a House)

### Structure:

Topic sentence (State the first advantage)
Explanation (Why is this an advantage?)
Example (A real-world example)
Body Paragraph 1:
✅ One significant advantage of living in a house is the availability of more space and comfort. Houses generally provide larger rooms, outdoor areas such as gardens, and additional storage space, making them ideal for families. For instance, children can play in a backyard, which is not possible in most apartments. Moreover, houses offer greater freedom and privacy, as they are detached properties, meaning there are no shared walls with neighbors. This allows residents to make renovations and play music without disturbing others.

## Step 5: Write Body Paragraph 2 (Disadvantages of Living in a House)

### Structure:

Topic sentence (State the first disadvantage)
Explanation (Why is this a disadvantage?)
Example (A real-world example)
Body Paragraph 2:
✅ Despite these advantages, living in a house also comes with some drawbacks. Firstly, the cost of purchasing or renting a house is typically much higher than that of an apartment, and utility bills, such as heating and electricity, tend to be more expensive due to the larger space. Additionally, homeowners are responsible for all maintenance, including plumbing, lawn care, and general repairs. For example, fixing a leaking roof or maintaining a garden requires both time and money, which may not be convenient for busy individuals.

## Step 6: Write the Conclusion (2-3 sentences)

### Structure:

Summarize the main points
Restate opinion (Clearly answer the question)
Conclusion:
✅ In conclusion, while living in a house provides more space and privacy, it also involves higher costs and maintenance responsibilities. However, for those who can afford it and value personal space, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making houses a preferable choice over apartments.
