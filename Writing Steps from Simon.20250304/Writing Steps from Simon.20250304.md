# IELTS Writing Task 2 – Rules & Steps (Simon’s IELTS Approach)

Simon’s method for IELTS Writing Task 2 is known for its clarity, logical structure, and simplicity. His approach ensures that candidates write a well-organized essay that is easy to read and score high on coherence, cohesion, and task response.

Rules of IELTS Writing Task 2 (Simon’s Approach)

1. Stick to a Simple but Effective Structure
   4-paragraph essay:
   Introduction (Paraphrase the question + Thesis statement)
   Body Paragraph 1 (First main idea + Explanation + Example)
   Body Paragraph 2 (Second main idea + Explanation + Example)
   Conclusion (Summarize main points + Restate opinion)
2. Answer All Parts of the Question
   If the question asks for both advantages and disadvantages, you must discuss both.
   If it asks "To what extent do you agree?", clearly state how much you agree or disagree.
3. Avoid Complex and Unnecessary Vocabulary
   Simon advises using natural, clear, and precise language instead of forcing complex words.
   Example:
   ✅ The government should invest more in public transport.
   ❌ The authorities ought to allocate significant fiscal resources to the enhancement of communal mobility infrastructures.
4. Develop Ideas Properly
   Use one clear idea per paragraph with supporting examples.
   Do not list too many points—develop 2 strong points well.
5. Stay Formal and Objective
   Do not use contractions (don’t → do not).
   Avoid informal language (kids → children, a lot of → many).
   No personal pronouns in opinion essays (I think → It is believed that).
6. Use a Variety of Sentence Structures
   Simple Sentences: The number of cars is increasing.
   Complex Sentences: As the number of cars increases, traffic congestion worsens.
   Compound Sentences: The government should improve public transport, and this would reduce pollution.
7. Plan Before Writing
   Spend 5 minutes planning to organize ideas before starting.
   This prevents running out of time or ideas while writing.
8. Write at Least 250 Words
   Writing fewer than 250 words will result in a lower score.
   Aim for 260-280 words for a balanced response.
9. Avoid Repetition
   Use synonyms or rephrase instead of repeating words.
   Example:
   Instead of "important" → use "essential," "vital," or "crucial."
10. Have a Strong Conclusion
    Summarize your opinion clearly and directly.
    Do not introduce new ideas in the conclusion.
    Steps to Write an IELTS Task 2 Essay (Simon’s Method)
    Step 1: Analyze the Question (2 min)
    Identify the type of question:
    Opinion (Agree/Disagree)
    Discussion (Both views)
    Advantages & Disadvantages
    Problem & Solution
    Two-part questions
    Underline keywords and task requirements.
    Step 2: Plan the Essay (5 min)
    Decide on your main points.
    Choose two strong arguments (one for each body paragraph).
    Think of a real-world example if possible.
    Step 3: Write the Introduction (5-6 sentences)
    Paraphrase the question – Use synonyms and change sentence structure.
    Give a thesis statement – Clearly state your position (agree/disagree, both views, etc.).
    Outline sentence (optional) – Briefly mention what you will discuss.
    Example (Question: "Some people think governments should invest more in public transport. To what extent do you agree?")
    ✅ Many believe that governments should allocate more funds to improving public transport systems. This essay agrees with this viewpoint, as better public transportation reduces traffic congestion and minimizes environmental pollution.

Step 4: Write Body Paragraphs (2 paragraphs)
Each paragraph should follow this structure:

Topic sentence (State your main point)
Explanation (Expand the idea)
Example (Give a real-world example)
Example (Body Paragraph 1)
✅ One key reason why governments should fund public transport is that it reduces traffic congestion. When people have access to efficient and affordable transportation, fewer private cars are used, leading to less traffic. For instance, in Singapore, significant investment in buses and trains has led to a dramatic reduction in road congestion.

Example (Body Paragraph 2)
✅ Another major benefit is the positive environmental impact. Fewer cars on the road mean lower emissions, contributing to cleaner air. For example, a study by the World Health Organization found that cities with well-developed public transport systems have significantly lower pollution levels.

Step 5: Write the Conclusion (2-3 sentences)
Summarize your main ideas.
Restate your opinion clearly.
Example Conclusion
✅ In conclusion, investing in public transport is crucial as it helps reduce congestion and pollution. Governments should prioritize this funding to improve the quality of life in urban areas.
